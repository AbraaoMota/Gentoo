PAPER SYNOPSIS:

These guys describe how they built their own tool Vulnscan

This is a good paper to demonstrate how intensive a scanner can be - loads of mutations per input. So much that they've got pruning techniques to make this more feasible

Performed better than zap against WebGoat

GOOD QUOTE
"There's no silver bullet for web application security; threats will continue to grow and evolve"


Ethics debate
Sys admins for vulnerable sites fix things after being told - is that good enough?

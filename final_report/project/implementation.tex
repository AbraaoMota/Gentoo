\section{Test harness}

In order to be able to appropriately test for features in development for this extension it is necessary to have access to a fragile website. It would not be ethical to use a website in production to test my extension against; doing so could result in all manner of adversities for the owner of that web address. That is under the assumption that I could firstly find a fragile website to test against; despite the prevalence of security weaknesses spread through the web, it is inherently a difficult task to identify and exploit these. Therefore, I have developed a deliberately weak website to test against. 

\section{Popup page}

This is the main interaction point for a user utilizing the extension. The layout of this page makes a clear distinction between different types of attacks.

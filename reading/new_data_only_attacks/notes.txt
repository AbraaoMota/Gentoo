PAPER SYNOPSIS:

DATA ONLY ATTACKS ARE USING MEMORY MAPPINGS TO NAVIGATE PROCESS MEMORY AT RUNTIME TO CREATE EXPLOITS
THIS CAN RESULT IN HTTP COOKIE LEAKAGE, CHANGING THE SOP FOR GIVEN WEBSITES
THIS GAP EXISTS BECAUSE WE CAN'T ACHIEVE PROCESS ISOLATION DUE TO LACK OF BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
Attemts to mitigate this include global variable randomization so these aren't accessed by any other process or exploited in a cross process way.

Security Implications of redirection trail problems

SYNOPSIS:

Not directly correlated to dissertation

How safe is URL redirection really? A redirection trail may look safe to user but only needs to end in HTTPS, may be unsafe inbetween

Conclusions:
  - the majority (83.3% in the 1M dataset and 78.6% in the 10K dataset) of redirection trails among web- sites that support only HTTPS are vulnerable to attacks
  - current incoherent practices (e.g., naked domains and www subdomains being redirected to different destinations with varying security levels) undermine the security guaran- tees provided by HTTPS and HSTS (HSTS is HTTP Strict Transport Security - prevents session degradation and cookie hijacking)

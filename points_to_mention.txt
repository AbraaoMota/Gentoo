Important points to mention:

What colour box is my tool?
  - "A state aware" paper has a list of references of tools that are white box, a lot of my papers are black box

Why is it black box?

Why user driven? Why is that a feature?
  - Organic
  - Focus on what matters
  - Using user driven applications means the user can make use of the ENTIRE webpage - we don't skip AJAX, JS, Flash or other plugins 'point and shoots'
    don't use
  - Crawling is a super critical part of these scanners, foregoing that skips a ton of trouble and gives a more in depth representation of the website
  - Skips having to look at things such as WIVET - benchmark for how well scanner goes through JS, Flash and form submissions

"Crawling is arguably the most important part of a web application vulnerability scanner; if the scannerâ€™s attack engine is poor, it might miss a vulnerability, but if its crawling engine is poor and cannot reach the vulnerability, then it will surely miss the vulnerability." - Why johnny can't pentest


Evaluation:
  As mentioned in the "state aware paper", the most important metric is
    - True vulnerabilities discovered
  Other important metrics include:
    - Number of False positives - a large number of these basically makes the application impossible to use and massively decreases trust in it
      noone wants to use something that declares bugs where they aren't. Looking into these is also an expensive process.
    - Application code coverage

  How to test my own application:
  - Have a test against WackoPicko - checkout the "Why johnny can't pentest" paper
  - Also look at HacmeBank, WebGoat, SiteGenerator

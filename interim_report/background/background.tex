\chapter{Background}

 This should form the bulk of the interim report. You should consider that your objective here is to produce a near final version of the background section, as it will appear in your final report.  All of this material should be re-usable, so it is worth getting it right at this stage of the project.  The details of what to include can be found in the Project Report guidelines.
 
 In writing the Background chapter you must demonstrate your capability of analysis, synthesis and critical judgement. Analysis is shown by explaining how the proposed solution operates in your own words as well as its benefits and consequences. Synthesis is shown through the organisation of your Related Work section and through identifying and generalising common aspects across different solutions. Critical judgement is shown by discussing the limitations of the solutions proposed both in terms of their disadvantages and limits of applicability.

# Gentoo

This is the repository for Gentoo, the semi-automated webapp vulnerability scanner. It is a Google Chrome extension created for my final year project.

## Installation

In order to install:

1. Open Google Chrome, and visit `chrome://extensions` to manage your extensions
2. Ensure you have enabled "Developer Mode"
3. Press the "Load unpacked" button
4. Find the downloaded source code and select the `src` folder.
5. Gentoo should appear as a usable extension. To use it, make sure its toggle button is enabled.

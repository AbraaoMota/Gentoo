Finding information for your individual projects - Angela Goldfinch


At the start
  - build knowledge base
  - ideas / problem solving
  - avoid duplication

Writing up:
  - evidence of new knowledge
  - where does your work fit in


Main sources of research papers are
  - peer reviewed journal articles - this gives a quality assurance for a paper that you read
  - conference papers - a lot of these aren't peer reviewed


Reading papers
  - Determine relevancy / usefulness -> Summary, introduction and conclusions are the most useful parts to read over


Finding research papers
  - google (scholar)
  - publisher websites
  - bibliographic databases

Library support page for referencing using Bibtex in latex

Manual input / Refworks -> Bibtex (same directory as report) -> Import into latex, bob's your uncle

            vancouver style apparently
\usepackage[numbers]{natbib}

\bibliographystyle{IEEEtranN}
\bibliography{References_file_name_here}

Refworks doesn't edit special latex characters
Remove shit added in notes when imported from some places

Good, well rounded, complete references give good marks
Think about audience - your references need to act as a source of further information
Provide date of access for any URL's used

books, journal articles and webpages should have complete references
Conference papers - quality of reference is variable
Other docs, provide:
  - url
  - access date
  - author / organisation
  - title of doc
  - publication date
  - report number if applicable

\chapter{Evaluation}

Project evaluation is very important, so it's important to think now about how you plan to measure success. For example, what functionality do you need to demonstrate?  What experiments to you need to undertake and what outcome(s) would constitute success?  What benchmarks should you use? How has your project extended the state of the art?  How do you measure qualitative aspects, such as ease of use?  These are the sort of questions that your project evaluation should address; this section should outline your plan.


\section{Intended functionality}

\section{Metrics of success}

\subsection{Correct reporting}

\subsection{False positives}

\subsection{Code coverage}

\subsection{Usability}

\section{Experiments}

Running an experiment where the volume of lifting done by the extension allows me to find a high number of vulns

Time taken

volume of interaction with the server

Accuracy of recommendations (not exactly false positives because its not fair to do so)

true positives - 


Passive mode of the extension to throw at a real website .. more muzzled - passive analysis of the traffic to try and flag up things that are interesting and 'tamperable' 
\subsection{Benchmarks}

\subsection{Ease of use}

\subsection{Educational purpose}

\section{Intellectual contributions}

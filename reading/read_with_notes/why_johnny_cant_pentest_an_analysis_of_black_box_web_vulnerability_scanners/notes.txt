Why Johnny can't pentest

SYNOPSIS:

PAPER LOOKS AT THE IMPORTANCE OF CRAWLING IN A BLACK-BOX WEB VULN SCANNER - WHY FINDING EVERY LINK IS IMPORTANT FOR THE FULL COVERAGE OF THE APPLICATION
THIS IS A MAJOR LIMITATION OF THESE CRAWLERS - A LOT OF THEM ARE LIMITED BY ONLY ACCESSING PARTS OF THE APPLICATION
GOOD RELATED WORK SECTION - EVALUATING SCANNERS AND PRODUCING TEST VULN SITES

This is a paper from 2010.. CHECK TO SEE IF CONCLUSIONS HAVE CHANGED IN MORE RECENT PAPER AFTER ALL THESE YEARS

Paper notes:

Several studies have shown limitations of 'state-of-the-art' scanners because these miss out on important vulnerabilities
This generates a false sense of security

It's important to evaluate whether scanners can find vulnerabilities deep in the application, or perhaps in the JS, complex form submission etc. Keeping track of state?

WackoPicko is a vulnerable application built to test that - with Complex JS and forms, dynamic pages etc

In general, web vuln scanners have 3 modules:
  - Crawler
  - Attacker
  - Analysis


Testing tools:
  HacmeBank
  WebGoat
  SiteGenerator

WackoPicko is a photo sharing site (with intended flaws similar sounding to the ones from vulnerable applications tested against in Kali 3rd year)

RELEVANT QUOTE:
"Crawling is arguably the most important part of a web application vulnerability scanner; if the scannerâ€™s attack engine is poor, it might miss a vulnerability, but if its crawling en- gine is poor and cannot reach the vulnerability, then it will surely miss the vulnerability."


They had a group of students with some security knowledge - they found more than the scanners - GREAT POINT TO NOT HAVE FULLY AUTOMATED SCANNERS

Default settings on inputs in these scanners largely affect their output, and will sometimes miss things because of odd default values etc

Interesting tool:
Hailstorm includes an embed- ded Mozilla browser for the user to browse the site when they want to do so manually,


Conclusions:
"Support for well- known, pervasive technology should be improved."

Tracking state is essential for a performant scanner

Improved reverse engineering necessary for better state tracking

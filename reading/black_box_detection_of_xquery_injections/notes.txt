PAPER SYNOPSIS:

XML AND XQUERY HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE IMPORTANT AND USED IN DATABASES AND AS SUCH IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO MINIMISE THE RISKS THESE POSE THROUGH POSSIBLE INJECTIONS.
SERVER SIDE VALIDATIONS ARE NOT YET MATURE ENOUGH TO KNOW TO HANDLE THESE AS WELL, SO THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF POTENTIAL UNCHECKED VULNERABILITIES
XQUERIES ARE QUERIES SUBMITTED TO AN XML DATABASE
